N Your Goal|ITEM|138258|N|You are searching for 5 ephemeral crystals somewhere in Azsuna. There are over 100 possible locations. When you find the fifth one, you get the mount and a zonewide message, "You hear a faint caw in the distance and then silence" tells any other treasure hunters it has been found. If you die, you will need to reclick any crystals you previously found. You have eight hours from first to last click, or until someone else clicks 5. For more info, google Forgotten Hippogryph or see comments accompanying this guide on wow-pro.com.|
N Ephemeral Crystals|N|This list is compiled from several internet sources. I have personally verified very few.  The coordinates may not be precise, and it is possible there are still some missing. I would assume you can at least see the crystal from that spot.|
N Flying|N|This is of course easier if you can fly, but it is not essential. The routes are laid out assuming you can not fly, (i.e. jump down cliffs, not fly up them), there is probably a more efficient route if you can.|
N Manual Checkoffs|N|After you observe each location you will need to manually right click the step to move on to the next step. We wouldn't want the guide to advance a step without you noticing and cause you to miss a spot.|
F Wardens' Redoubt|N|Guide starts at Warden's Redoubt because...well, you have to start somewhere.|
