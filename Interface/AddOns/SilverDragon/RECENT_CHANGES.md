## Changed in v2022.23

* The popup can now know about loot in treasures, including whether to give the popup the mount-alert treatment
    * It only knows about the loot in a few Zereth Mortis treasures currently; I'm not sure how much I'm going to backfill this
* Right-clicking the pins on the world map will work again (10.0.0 broke this)
* Fix several ways that SilverDragon (+ the new 10.0.0 frame layout system) could cause taint that would eventually block some actions
* Minor work towards 10.0.2 compatibility
* Zereth Mortis: show all Gorkek's spawn points
